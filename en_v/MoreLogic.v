(** * Existential Quantification *)

(** Another critical logical connective is _existential
    quantification_.  We can express it with the following
    definition: *)

Inductive ex (X:Type) (P : X->Prop) : Prop :=
  ex_intro : forall (witness:X), P witness -> ex X P.

(** That is, [ex] is a family of propositions indexed by a type [X]
    and a property [P] over [X].  In order to give evidence for the
    assertion "there exists an [x] for which the property [P] holds"
    we must actually name a _witness_ -- a specific value [x] -- and
    then give evidence for [P x], i.e., evidence that [x] has the
    property [P]. 

*)


(** *** *)
(** Coq's [Notation] facility can be used to introduce more
    familiar notation for writing existentially quantified
    propositions, exactly parallel to the built-in syntax for
    universally quantified propositions.  Instead of writing [ex nat
    ev] to express the proposition that there exists some number that
    is even, for example, we can write [exists x:nat, ev x].  (It is
    not necessary to understand exactly how the [Notation] definition
    works.) *)

Notation "'exists' x , p" := (ex _ (fun x => p))
  (at level 200, x ident, right associativity) : type_scope.
Notation "'exists' x : X , p" := (ex _ (fun x:X => p))
  (at level 200, x ident, right associativity) : type_scope.

(** *** *)
(** We can use the usual set of tactics for
    manipulating existentials.  For example, to prove an
    existential, we can [apply] the constructor [ex_intro].  Since the
    premise of [ex_intro] involves a variable ([witness]) that does
    not appear in its conclusion, we need to explicitly give its value
    when we use [apply]. *)

Example exists_example_1 : exists n, n + (n * n) = 6.
Proof.
  apply ex_intro with (witness:=2). 
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Note that we have to explicitly give the witness. *)

(** *** *)
(** Or, instead of writing [apply ex_intro with (witness:=e)] all the
    time, we can use the convenient shorthand [exists e], which means
    the same thing. *)

Example exists_example_1' : exists n, n + (n * n) = 6.
Proof.
  exists 2. 
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** *** *)
(** Conversely, if we have an existential hypothesis in the
    context, we can eliminate it with [inversion].  Note the use
    of the [as...] pattern to name the variable that Coq
    introduces to name the witness value and get evidence that
    the hypothesis holds for the witness.  (If we don't
    explicitly choose one, Coq will just call it [witness], which
    makes proofs confusing.) *)

(** * Evidence-Carrying Booleans *)

(** So far we've seen two different forms of equality predicates:
    [eq], which produces a [Prop], and the type-specific forms, like
    [beq_nat], that produce [boolean] values.  The former are more
    convenient to reason about, but we've relied on the latter to let
    us use equality tests in _computations_.  While it is
    straightforward to write lemmas (e.g. [beq_nat_true] and
    [beq_nat_false]) that connect the two forms, using these lemmas
    quickly gets tedious. *)

(** *** *)
(** It turns out that we can get the benefits of both forms at once by
    using a construct called [sumbool]. *)

Inductive sumbool (A B : Prop) : Set :=
 | left : A -> sumbool A B 
 | right : B -> sumbool A B.

Notation "{ A } + { B }" :=  (sumbool A B) : type_scope.

(** Think of [sumbool] as being like the [boolean] type, but instead
    of its values being just [true] and [false], they carry _evidence_
    of truth or falsity. This means that when we [destruct] them, we
    are left with the relevant evidence as a hypothesis -- just as
    with [or].  (In fact, the definition of [sumbool] is almost the
    same as for [or].  The only difference is that values of [sumbool]
    are declared to be in [Set] rather than in [Prop]; this is a
    technical distinction that allows us to compute with them.) *)

(** *** *)

(** Here's how we can define a [sumbool] for equality on [nat]s *)

Theorem eq_nat_dec : forall n m : nat, {n = m} + {n <> m}.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros n.
  induction n as [|n'].
  Case "n = 0".
    intros m.
    destruct m as [|m'].
    SCase "m = 0".
      left. reflexivity.
    SCase "m = S m'".
      right. intros contra. inversion contra.
  Case "n = S n'".
    intros m.
    destruct m as [|m'].
    SCase "m = 0".
      right. intros contra. inversion contra.
    SCase "m = S m'". 
      destruct IHn' with (m := m') as [eq | neq].
      left. apply f_equal.  apply eq.
      right. intros Heq. inversion Heq as [Heq']. apply neq. apply Heq'.
Defined. 
  
(** Read as a theorem, this says that equality on [nat]s is decidable:
    that is, given two [nat] values, we can always produce either
    evidence that they are equal or evidence that they are not.  Read
    computationally, [eq_nat_dec] takes two [nat] values and returns a
    [sumbool] constructed with [left] if they are equal and [right] if
    they are not; this result can be tested with a [match] or, better,
    with an [if-then-else], just like a regular [boolean].  (Notice
    that we ended this proof with [Defined] rather than [Qed].  The
    only difference this makes is that the proof becomes
    _transparent_, meaning that its definition is available when Coq
    tries to do reductions, which is important for the computational
    interpretation.) *) 

(** *** *)
(** Here's a simple example illustrating the advantages of the
   [sumbool] form. *)

Definition override' {X: Type} (f: nat->X) (k:nat) (x:X) : nat->X:=
  fun (k':nat) => if eq_nat_dec k k' then x else f k'.

Theorem override_same' : forall (X:Type) x1 k1 k2 (f : nat->X),
  f k1 = x1 -> 
  (override' f k1 x1) k2 = f k2.
Proof.
  intros X x1 k1 k2 f. intros Hx1.

  Case "k1 = k2".
    rewrite <- e.
    symmetry. apply Hx1.
  Case "k1 <> k2".

(** Compare this to the more laborious proof (in MoreCoq.v) for the
    version of [override] defined using [beq_nat], where we had to use
    the auxiliary lemma [beq_nat_true] to convert a fact about
    booleans to a Prop. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (all_forallb)  *)
(** Inductively define a property [all] of lists, parameterized by a
    type [X] and a property [P : X -> Prop], such that [all X P l]

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge)  *)
(** One of the main purposes of Coq is to prove that programs match
    their specifications.  To this end, let's prove that our
    definition of [filter] matches a specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English.

    Suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a list
    [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an "in-order
    merge" of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item in [l1]
    satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then [filter
    test l = l1].

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example, 
    [1,4,6,2,3]
    is an in-order merge of
    [1,6,2]
    and
    [4,3].
    Your job is to translate this specification into a Coq theorem and
    prove it.  (Hint: You'll need to begin by defining what it means
    for one list to be a merge of two others.  Do this with an
    inductive relation, not a [Fixpoint].)  *)

    goes like this: Among all subsequences of [l] with the property

    l] is the longest.  Express this claim formally and prove it. *)

(** Now use [appears_in] to define a proposition [disjoint X l1 l2],

(** Next, use [appears_in] to define an inductive proposition
    [no_repeats X l], which should be provable exactly when [l] is a

    [no_repeats bool []] should be provable, while [no_repeats nat
    [1,2,1]] and [no_repeats bool [true,true]] should not be.  *)

    number consecutively.  The predicate "[nostutter mylist]" means
    that [mylist] does not stutter.  Formulate an inductive definition
    for [nostutter].  (This is different from the [no_repeats]

   pigeonhole must contain at least two items.  As is often the case,
   this apparently trivial fact about numbers requires non-trivial
   machinery to prove, but we now have enough... *)

(** Now here's a way to formalize the pigeonhole principle. List [l2]
    represents a list of pigeonhole labels, and list [l1] represents
    the labels assigned to a list of items: if there are more items
    than labels, at least two items must have the same label.  This
    proof is much easier if you use the [excluded_middle] hypothesis
    to show that [appears_in] is decidable, i.e. [forall x
    l, (appears_in x l) \/ ~ (appears_in x l)].  However, it is also
    possible to make the proof go through _without_ assuming that
    [appears_in] is decidable; if you can manage to do this, you will
    not need the [excluded_middle] hypothesis. *)
